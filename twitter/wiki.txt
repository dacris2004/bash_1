   Type      New Religious Movement                                           
   Founder   Frederick Adams                                                  

   Feraferia is a Nevada City, California-based Neopagan community,
   practicing Hellenic-inspired Goddess worship.

   The founder of the group, Frederick McLaren Charles Adams II, met and was
   deeply influenced by Robert Graves and his book The White Goddess. In
   1957, Adams founded the classically inspired Fellowship of Hesperides and
   in 1959, he started a multi-family intentional community in Sierra Madre,
   California. Feraferia was established 1967 in southern California as a
   continuation of the Fellowship of Hesperides, and as such, it is one of
   the oldest organizations of Neopaganism in the United States.^[1]^[2]

   During the 1970s, Adams, with Carroll "Poke" Runyon of the Ordo Templi
   Astartes, and Oberon Zell of the Church of All Worlds formed The Council
   of Themis, the first attempt to unite various hermetic, Neopagan, and
   ceremonial magic groups in the United States. Adams, and Feraferia, were
   represented in Runyon's early Neopagan magazine, The 7th Ray, with Adams
   illustrating as well as writing, expositions on the Feraferia approach to
   what later became known as the Goddess movement.

   Adams died in August 2008.
